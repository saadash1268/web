                    <p>My tech journey began with my environmental geography degree, where I used geospatial technology to map pollution trends.</p>
                    <p>After graduating, I worked in the care sector, supporting young people with learning disabilities. Here I saw the impact of accessible technology, such as communication apps for non-verbal children, and recognised the need for inclusive design and accessibility in enhancing lives.</p>
                    <p>Motivated to learn more about tech, I was chosen from over 3,500 applicants to join the School of Code's 16-week web development bootcamp. This intense program honed my coding skills and fostered a mindset of continuous learning, collaboration, and creative problem-solving.</p>
                    <p>Now, as I step into the professional world, my goal is to join an organisation where I can continue to grow and apply my skills. I'm eager to contribute to projects that prioritise innovative and accessible solutions.</p>
